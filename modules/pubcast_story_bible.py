pubcast_story_bible.py — Canonical narrative lore for PubCast Alpha
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Rear View Foresight LLC · Feic Mo Chroí™

This module contains the full story bible for PubCast's narrative layer:
the game mode storyline, the TikTok movie arc, character autobiographical
roots, the double feature premiere, and the thematic spine that ties
the tutorial to the emotional core.

Other modules (room_conductor, jeremy_cricket, character_engine, bots)
can import from here to stay canon-consistent when generating dialogue,
scene descriptions, or contextual AI responses.

NOTE: This is FICTION. The characters are loosely inspired by facets of
the creator's life but they are not autobiographical transcriptions.
There is a happy ending in the fiction. Whether reality follows is TBD.
