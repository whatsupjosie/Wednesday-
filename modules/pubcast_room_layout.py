"""
pubcast_room_layout.py — Canonical spatial layout for PubCast Alpha
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Rear View Foresight LLC · Feic Mo Chroí™

Defines the room graph, navigation connections, avatar rendering rules,
and background specifications for every room in the Belle Époque Studios
2.5D world.

GREEN ROOM is the hub. All doors are visible from here. It connects
directly to: Dressing Room, Writers Room, Studio, Control Room, Bar,
and the Hallway that leads to the Lobby and Palace Theater.

AVATARS are glowing ethereal SVG energy figures — translucent, graceful,
luminous. NOT sprites. NOT pixel art. NOT cel-shaded. Each character has
a signature glow color, radial gradient body, and a foot-glow pool.
Pete is teal. RePete is cool blue. Purfluous is purple. The user's
color is configurable.

Navigation is 2.5D side-scroll with E to enter doors. Rooms transition
via parallax pan with lighting shift.
